#steps
#1 Create a program that asks the user, "What is the capital of France?" and then waits for their response.
#2 If they type the correct response ("Paris"), the program should show that the message entered is correct.
#3 It would print incorrectly if the response was incorrect.

#applying the variable question.
Answer = input("What is the capital of France?:")
if Answer =="Paris" : #inserting the answer to the question
    print("the answer is correct") #if the answer is Paris then it will be correct
else:
    print("the answer is wrong.") #If the answer will be wrong it won't be paris
